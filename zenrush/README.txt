Zenrush integration plugin for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

This plugin will integrate the Zenrush Premium Delivery option into your WooCommerce store. It will add a new shipping method to your store and allows you to display a new element on product pages to calculate the delivery date for the product ahead of time. This boosts conversion rates and increases customer satisfaction.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `zenrush` Folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the Zenrush Settings to configure the plugin. You will need to add a Merchant Key before the plugin will work.

== Settings ==

- Merchant Key: This is the key that the Zenfulfillment Customer Support will provide you with. It is used to authenticate your store with Zenrush. Required.
- Automatic Front-End integration: These settings control if the plugin should add the Zenrush Delivery Timer to the product page and if it should add the Zenrush Delivery Date to the product category pages. Both are enabled by default.
